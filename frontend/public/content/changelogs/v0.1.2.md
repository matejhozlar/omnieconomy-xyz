**Release Date:** October 28, 2025

# New Features

## Anonymous Telemetry System

- Added optional anonymous telemetry to help track mod usage and improve future development
- Telemetry collects only:
  - Unique anonymous server ID (randomly generated UUID stored locally)
  - Mod version
  - Minecraft version
  - Server heartbeat (sent hourly when enabled)
- **Privacy First**:
  - Completely anonymous - no server names, player data, or identifying information
  - Can be disabled at any time via config (`enableTelemetry = false` in `omnieconomy-common.toml`)
  - Runs silently in the background with no console spam
  - Fails gracefully if offline or unreachable
- Server ID is stored locally in `omnieconomy_server_id.dat` in your world folder
- Helps developers understand active installations and version distribution

# Bug Fixes

- Fixed visual client bugs occurring on ATM

# Configuration

- New config option: `enableTelemetry` (default: true)
  - Set to `false` in `omnieconomy-common.toml` to completely disable telemetry
