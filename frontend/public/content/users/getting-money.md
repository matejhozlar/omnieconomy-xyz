# Getting Your First Money

There are several ways to earn money in OmniEconomy:

## 1. Daily Rewards

The easiest way to start! Simply type `/daily` every 24 hours to claim your reward.

## 2. Kill Mobs

Most hostile mobs have a chance to drop currency bills when killed:

- **Common Mobs** (Zombies, Spiders, Creepers, Skeletons): 2% chance to drop $1
- **Rare Drop**: All mobs have a 0.02% chance to drop $5 bills
- **Nether Mobs** (Wither Skeletons, Blazes): Better chances for currency

> **Pro Tip**: Use the Capitalist Greed enchantment on your weapon to increase drop rates!

## 3. Playtime Rewards

If enabled by your server admin, you'll automatically earn money for playing:

- Default: $10 every 5 minutes of active gameplay
- Daily cap prevents excessive farming (default: $1,000/day)
- AFK players don't earn rewards (if AFK detection is enabled)

## 4. Trading with Players

Buy and sell items with other players using physical bills or direct transfers.
